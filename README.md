# Algorithm Visualizer in C++ using Windows Console API

---

## **Goal of the Project**

To **visualize the step-by-step execution** of fundamental algorithms (like sorting, graph traversal, and dynamic programming) **in the console**, making abstract concepts **visible and understandable**.

---

## **What It Does**

* Shows how algorithms work **internally**
* Lets the user **see changes in data** (like array swaps or visited nodes)
* Displays **time complexity concepts** in real-time (step count, delays)

---

## Example Use Case

You're teaching someone how Bubble Sort works. Instead of drawing diagrams or explaining in words, you run your program:

* The console shows each step
* Highlights the two elements being compared
* Shows the array gradually getting sorted

They **see the logic come alive**.
